In this project I have built an artificial intelligence model that predicts house prices using sklearn multiple linear regression algortihm.

Installations :
Install pandas and scikit-learn

Execution steps :
1. Open the ipynb file in visual studio code
2. Add the csv file
3. And open the house.py file and run it.
